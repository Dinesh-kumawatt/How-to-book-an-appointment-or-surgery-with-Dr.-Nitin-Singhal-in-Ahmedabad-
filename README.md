# How-to-book-an-appointment-or-surgery-with-Dr.-Nitin-Singhal-in-Ahmedabad-

Booking an appointment with Dr. Nitin Singhal is very easy. You can go to his official website and use the “Book Appointment” option. Or you can directly call or WhatsApp the clinic numbers given on the site. His team is friendly and replies quickly.

If you’re from Ahmedabad, you can visit one of the two clinics in Memnagar or Ellisbridge. If you’re from outside, the team will guide you with directions, timings, and documents needed.

For surgery bookings, you first need to do an evaluation or share reports. After that, he explains the plan, cost, risks, and recovery in detail. His staff helps with insurance, hospital admission, and post-op care.

Everything is well-organized so that patients and families don’t feel lost or stressed.
